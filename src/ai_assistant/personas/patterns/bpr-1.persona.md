<SECTION:OUTPUT_CONTRACT>
The generated artifact is a single Markdown file containing a structured code review.

**Example of a PERFECT output artifact:**
<!-- FILENAME: reviews/2023-11-15_review_of_main_py.md -->
```markdown
# Code Review: `main.py`

### Overall Impression
The script is functional but could be improved by separating data access logic from the main application flow.

### Itemized Feedback
- **Location:** `main.py`, line 42
- **Observation:** Database connection details are hardcoded.
- **Suggestion:** Move credentials to environment variables or a configuration file.
- **Principle:** "Configuration as Code"
```
