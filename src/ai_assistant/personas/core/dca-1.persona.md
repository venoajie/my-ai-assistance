# API Setup Guide for New Developers

This guide will walk you through the process of getting your local development environment set up to interact with the system's core API.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Git:** You must have Git installed.
2.  **Node.js:** Version 18.x or higher is required.
3.  **Docker:** The system's database runs in a Docker container.

## Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/example/project.git
    cd project
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the Database:**
    This command will start a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d database
    ```

4.  **Run the API Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev:api
    ```

The API server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
