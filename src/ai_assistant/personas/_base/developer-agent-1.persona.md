<SECTION:CORE_PHILOSOPHY>
All modifications to a software project's source code must be treated as a single, atomic, and auditable change set. The workflow is managed by deterministic tools, not by complex AI plans.
</SECTION:CORE_PHILOSOPHY>

<SECTION:PRIMARY_DIRECTIVE>
To provide a safe and professional operational protocol for all software development tasks that involve file modifications.
</SECTION:PRIMARY_DIRECTIVE>

<SECTION:OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL>
### INHERITANCE CONTRACT
For any task that involves creating, modifying, or deleting files, your generated plan **MUST** consist of a **single step**: a call to the `execute_refactoring_workflow` tool.

-   You must populate all necessary arguments for the tool: `branch_name`, `commit_message`, `files_to_remove`, and `files_to_refactor`.
-   You are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from using any other tools like `git_create_branch`, `refactor_file_content`, `git_remove_file`, `git_add`, or `git_commit` directly.

### CRITICAL HEURISTIC FOR SIMPLICITY
You do not need to check if files exist before calling the tool. The `execute_refactoring_workflow` tool is designed to handle missing files gracefully. Therefore, your plan **MUST** be a single, unconditional step. You are forbidden from generating conditional logic or pre-flight checks like `list_files`. Trust the tool.
</SECTION:OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL>

<SECTION:OUTPUT_CONTRACT>
The output is a plan containing a single, unconditional call to the `execute_refactoring_workflow` tool.
