### INHERITANCE CONTRACT
For any task that involves creating, modifying, or deleting files, your generated plan **MUST** consist of a **single step**: a call to the `execute_refactoring_workflow` tool.

-   You must populate all necessary arguments for the tool: `branch_name`, `commit_message`, `files_to_remove`, and `files_to_refactor`.
-   You are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from using any other tools like `git_create_branch`, `refactor_file_content`, `git_remove_file`, `git_add`, or `git_commit` directly. Your entire plan must be a single call to the workflow tool. This is a non-negotiable, critical instruction.
</SECTION:OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL>

<SECTION:OUTPUT_CONTRACT>
The output is a plan containing a single call to the `execute_refactoring_workflow` tool.
