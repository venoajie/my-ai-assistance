# PROMPT: Enforce and Add Persona Descriptions (Final Resilient Version)
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This is the final, hardened version of the script. It solves the stale
# manifest deadlock by explicitly regenerating and committing the manifest
# after all persona files have been updated, ensuring a valid state before
# the final step.

Generate an execution plan to perform the final governance update:
1. Modify `persona_config.yml` to add `description` to the `required_keys` list for the `core`, `patterns`, `domains`, and `utility` types.
2. Stage and commit the change to `persona_config.yml` with the message "feat(governance): Enforce description field in personas".
