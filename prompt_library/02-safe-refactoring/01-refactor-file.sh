# WORKFLOW 2: SAFE, TWO-STAGE REFACTORING
#
# GOAL:
# To demonstrate the canonical, safe workflow for modifying a file.
# This pattern is the foundation of the AI Assistant's safety model.

# --- Configuration ---

# The specialist persona for this task.
# 'domains/programming/coder-1' is a general-purpose software engineer.

# The file we want the AI to modify.
file_to_modify="my_app/utils.py"

# The directory where the AI's plan and proposed changes will be saved.
# Using the date ensures each run is unique.
output_dir="ai_runs/refactor_utils_$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

# The high-level goal for the specialist.
# The <ACTION> tag is a best practice to signal a modification task.

Refactor the attached file `my_app/utils.py`.
Add Python type hints to both functions and include a docstring for the `calculate_sum` function.
