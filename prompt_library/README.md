# AI Assistant: Prompt Library

This directory contains a set of best-practice, executable scripts that demonstrate the core workflows of the AI Assistant. They are designed to be a hands-on tutorial for new users.

### A Note on AI Reliability
**The AI is a powerful tool, but it is not perfect.** It can make mistakes. Always review the plans and code generated by the assistant before you approve them. These scripts are tutorials designed to show you *how* to use the tool safely, with you as the final checkpoint.

## The Tutorial Path

The scripts are numbered to provide a clear learning path. It is highly recommended to run them in order:

1.  **`01-basic-analysis/`**: Start here. This script shows how to perform a safe, read-only analysis of a file without making any changes.
2.  **`02-safe-refactoring/`**: This is the most important workflow. It demonstrates the critical two-stage process (`--output-dir` and `ai-execute`) for safely modifying files.
3.  **`03-project-specific-tasks/`**: Learn how to create and use a custom, project-local persona to make the AI an expert on your specific needs.
4.  **`04-advanced-orchestration/`**: See how to use a simple shell script to automate a repetitive task across multiple files, demonstrating a powerful pattern for batch processing.

## How to Use

1.  Navigate into a script's directory (e.g., `cd 01-basic-analysis`).
2.  Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within that directory.
3.  Make the script executable: `chmod +x *.sh`.
4.  Run the script: `./*.sh`.
