Of course. This is the most critical part: translating the project management structure into a daily, operational rhythm.

Here is a "cheatsheet" of the essential CLI prompts you would use to manage your new project pipeline. These prompts are designed to be both powerful and ergonomic, making the AI a true partner in your development lifecycle.

---

### The Core Workflow Rhythm

Your daily interaction will follow a simple, powerful loop for each task:

1.  **Plan:** Use a specialist persona to generate a plan and an output package.
2.  **Review:** Check the `summary.md` and code in the `ai_runs/` directory.
3.  **Execute:** Apply the changes with `ai-execute`.
4.  **Commit:** Commit the code changes to your feature branch.
5.  **Update Status:** Use the `pmo-1` persona to update the project charter.
6.  **Commit Again:** Commit the project status change.

### Critical CLI Prompts for Your Pipeline

Here are the copy-paste-ready prompts for each stage of a project's lifecycle.

#### 1. Project Initiation: Creating a New Project

This is how you would kick off a brand new project, like a "Tool-Aware Critic" from your roadmap.

**Goal:** Create a new project charter for `P-003` and add it to the program dashboard.

```bash
# PROMPT 1: CREATE NEW PROJECT CHARTER
ai --persona core/pmo-1 --output-dir ./ai_runs/init-project-P003 \
  -f .ai_pmo/PROGRAM_STATE.md \
  -f .ai_pmo/projects/P-002_RAG_IMPLEMENTATION.md \
  "<ACTION>
  1. Your primary input is the attached PROGRAM_STATE.md and the P-002 charter, which you will use as a template.
  2. Create a new project charter file for a new project with the ID 'P-003'.
  3. The goal for P-003 is: 'Implement a Tool-Aware Adversarial Critic by providing it with machine-readable manifests of each tool's capabilities and safety features.'
  4. Break this goal down into a logical, multi-phase roadmap within the new charter file. Assign appropriate specialist personas.
  5. Add the new P-003 project to the portfolio table in PROGRAM_STATE.md with a 'PLANNING' status and 'High' priority.
  6. Place both the new charter (named P-003_TOOL_AWARE_CRITIC.md) and the updated PROGRAM_STATE.md into the workspace.
  </ACTION>"
```

#### 2. Daily Execution: Working on a Project Phase

This is your most common command. It's how you instruct a specialist AI to perform its assigned task.

**Goal:** Execute Phase 1 of the RAG project (`P-002`).

```bash
# PROMPT 2: EXECUTE A PROJECT PHASE
ai --persona domains/programming/python-expert-1 --output-dir ./ai_runs/p002-phase1-impl \
  -f .ai_pmo/projects/P-002_RAG_IMPLEMENTATION.md \
  -f PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md \
  -f pyproject.toml \
  "<ACTION>
  Your task brief is defined in the attached project charter 'P-002_RAG_IMPLEMENTATION.md' under 'Phase 1'.
  
  Your objective is to implement the Indexing Service.
  
  1. Analyze the project's dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
  2. Choose a suitable local vector database (e.g., ChromaDB) and an embedding model.
  3. Create a new script in `scripts/indexer.py` that contains the logic for scanning, chunking, and embedding project files.
  4. Modify `pyproject.toml` to include the new dependencies.
  5. Place both new and modified files in the workspace.
  </ACTION>"
```

#### 3. Project Management: Updating Status After a Phase

After you've executed and committed the code from the step above, you must update the project's status. This is the control mechanism.

**Goal:** Mark Phase 1 of the RAG project as complete and update the program dashboard.

```bash
# PROMPT 3: UPDATE PROJECT STATUS
ai --persona core/pmo-1 --output-dir ./ai_runs/update-p002-status-to-phase2 \
  -f .ai_pmo/PROGRAM_STATE.md \
  -f .ai_pmo/projects/P-002_RAG_IMPLEMENTATION.md \
  "<ACTION>
  Phase 1 of project P-002 is now complete.
  
  1. In the 'P-002_RAG_IMPLEMENTATION.md' charter file:
     - Change the status of 'Phase 1' to 'COMPLETE'.
     - Change the status of 'Phase 2' from 'BLOCKED' to 'PENDING'.
  2. In the 'PROGRAM_STATE.md' dashboard file:
     - Change the overall status of project P-002 to 'IN_PROGRESS'.
  3. Place both updated files in the workspace.
  </ACTION>"
```

#### 4. Quality Assurance: Performing a Review

Before merging a major feature, you can use the architect persona to perform a final review.

**Goal:** Review the completed code for Phase 1 of the RAG project.

```bash
# PROMPT 4: PERFORM AN ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW
ai --persona core/arc-1 --output-dir ./ai_runs/review-p002-phase1 \
  -f .ai_pmo/projects/P-002_RAG_IMPLEMENTATION.md \
  -f PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md \
  -f scripts/indexer.py \
  -f pyproject.toml \
  "<ACTION>
  You are performing an architectural review of the completed Phase 1 of the RAG project.
  
  1. The project's goal is defined in the attached charter 'P-002...md'.
  2. The system's architectural principles are in 'PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md'.
  3. The implementation is in the new 'scripts/indexer.py' and the modified 'pyproject.toml'.
  
  Generate a formal review report in Markdown. Assess the implementation for correctness, adherence to architectural principles, and readiness for the next phase. Place the report in the workspace.
  </ACTION>"
```
