Update the architectural documentation to formally integrate the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline architecture. In PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md, add a new section 5.4 'RAG Pipeline Architecture' that describes how the indexing service, retriever plugin, and kernel integration work together. In docs/system_contracts.yml, add a new persistent contract for 'Vector Index' that defines the structure for the RAG index files and their location. Ensure both documents maintain consistency with the existing architectural principles and data contract patterns.
