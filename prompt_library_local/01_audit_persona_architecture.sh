Perform a full architectural audit of the attached persona files.

Specifically, I want you to:
1.  Assess if the chosen base persona (`bcaa-1` vs. `btaa-1`) is appropriate for each specialist's stated function.
2.  Identify any inconsistencies or weaknesses in the `OPERATIONAL_PROTOCOL` of the `si-1` and `csa-1` personas.
3.  Propose any refactoring that would improve the clarity and reliability of the overall ecosystem.
