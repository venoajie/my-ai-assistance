# AI Assistant: Your Command-Line Co-Pilot

Welcome to the AI Assistant, a command-line tool designed to be your collaborative partner in software development. It helps you write code, debug issues, review architecture, and automate tasks, all from your terminal.

The assistant's power comes from its **Persona System** and a **safety-first design**, which allows you to confidently delegate complex tasks to specialized AI agents.

## Key Features

-   **Expert Persona System:** Assign tasks to pre-built expert profiles for higher-quality, consistent results.
-   **Project-Specific Customization:** Easily create your own local personas and plugins to teach the assistant about your project's unique architecture and requirements.
-   **Safety-First Workflow:** A robust two-stage workflow separates AI analysis from deterministic execution, giving you a chance to review and approve all changes.
-   **Adversarial Plan Validation:** Before execution, plans are reviewed by a skeptical AI critic to identify potential flaws and risks.

```bash
# For stable use
