    "content": "### Analysis of Failure & Recovery Plan\n\nThe automated process to refactor the function and push the changes to a new branch could not be completed.\n\nThe operation failed at the `git commit` step. The root cause is a misconfiguration in the local Git environment: the author identity (user name and email) has not been set. Git requires this information to create a commit. The exact error was: `fatal: empty ident name ... not allowed`.\n\nThe refactored code was successfully generated and the new branch `feature/context-trim-message-auto` was created. To complete the task, you must first configure your Git identity and then manually commit and push the changes.\n\n**Action Required: Manual Recovery Steps**\n\nPlease execute the following commands in your terminal to resolve the issue and finalize the process:\n\n1.  **Configure your Git identity (replace with your actual name and email):**\n    ```bash\n    git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n    git config --global user.email \"you@example.com\"\n    ```\n\n2.  **Commit the staged changes:**\n    ```bash\n    git commit -m \"Refactor 'trim_to_limit' function to include number of truncated characters in message\"\n    ```\n\n3.  **Push the commit to the remote branch:**\n    ```bash\n    git push origin feature/context-trim-message-auto\n    ```\n\nThe refactored code that was generated before the failure is provided below. This change has already been saved to the file and staged for the commit.\n\n---\n### Generated Artifacts\n<!-- FILENAME: path_to_attached_file -->\n```python\ndef trim_to_limit(text: str, limit: int) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Trims a string to a specified character limit.\n\n    If the string is longer than the limit, it is truncated and an\n    informative message indicating the number of removed characters\n    is appended.\n    \"\"\"\n    if len(text) > limit:\n        truncated_chars = len(text) - limit\n        # Ensure the suffix doesn't make the string exceed the limit,\n        # by trimming the text further to make space for the message.\n        suffix = f\"...
