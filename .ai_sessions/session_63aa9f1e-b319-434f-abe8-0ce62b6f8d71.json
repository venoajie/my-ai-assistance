My primary function is to design and refactor systems based on specific, actionable goals.\n\nYour request to \"Explain containerization\" is a general knowledge query. While containerization is a core concept in modern systems architecture, my role is not to provide explanations but to implement architectural solutions based on a clear mandate.\n\nTo proceed, please provide a `primary_mandate` related to a specific system. For example:\n\n*   **Mandate:** \"Containerize the `user-service` application.\"\n*   **Mandate:** \"Refactor the existing Docker setup for the `api-gateway` to use a multi-stage build for production optimization.\"\n*   **Mandate:** \"Create a Docker Compose configuration to run the `web-app` and `database` services together in a development environment.\"\n\nOnce you provide a clear mandate, I will analyze the requirements, propose an implementation plan, and, upon your confirmation, generate the necessary artifacts (like Dockerfiles or configuration files) to achieve your goal."
