# AI Assistant Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the AI Assistant. This site provides in-depth guides to help you get the most out of the tool, whether you are a new user or an experienced developer looking to contribute.

## Getting Started

If you are new to the project, we recommend starting with the main [Project README](../README.md), which covers installation and basic usage.

## Core Concepts

This documentation is divided into several key areas:

-   **[The Persona System](./personas.md):** This is the most important guide. Learn how to use the built-in expert personas and how to create your own to tailor the assistant to your specific needs.

-   **[Prompting Best Practices](./prompting_guide.md):** Discover the tips and tricks for writing effective prompts that lead to reliable, high-quality results.

-   **[Extending the Assistant with Plugins](./plugins.md):** For advanced users, this guide will cover how to create custom plugins to inject domain-specific knowledge into the assistant.
