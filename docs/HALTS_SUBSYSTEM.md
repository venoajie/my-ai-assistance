# Heuristic Analysis and Latency Triaging Subsystem (HALTS)

- **Version**: 1.0 (Prototype)
- **Status**: Under Development

## 1. Core Purpose

The Heuristic Analysis and Latency Triaging Subsystem (HALTS) is a planned internal component for the AI Assistant. Its primary function is to monitor the performance of LLM API calls and intelligently intervene to prevent cascading failures or excessive wait times for the user. It is designed to act as a smart circuit-breaker.

## 2. Key Features

- **Dynamic Latency Throttling:** If a specific model provider (e.g., DeepSeek) shows a spike in latency, HALTS will temporarily down-rank it in the model selection process.
- **Pre-flight Anomaly Detection:** Before sending a request, HALTS will perform a quick heuristic check on the prompt. If it detects patterns that are known to cause issues (e.g., excessively long, unformatted code blocks), it will log a warning.
